# LoRaMesh.ino README

## Introduction
This C code provides an example sketch demonstrating how to create a simple messaging client (transmitter) using LoRa technology. It utilizes the RH_RF95 class for communication. Please note that RH_RF95 does not provide addressing or reliability features, so it's suitable for basic messaging needs.

## Requirements
- Arduino board compatible with LoRa technology
- RH_RF95 library
- SoftwareSerial library (if applicable)
- SPI library

## Hardware Setup
- Connect the LoRa module according to the pin configurations defined in the code.
- Ensure proper connections and power supply.

## Usage
1. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
2. Ensure that all necessary libraries are installed.
3. Run the code and observe the serial monitor for messages and interactions.

## Code Overview
- The code initializes the LoRa module and sets up necessary configurations.
- It defines message structures and functions for sending and receiving messages.
- Network operations such as node addition, removal, and nomination of a master node are implemented.
- Heartbeat functionality is included for monitoring node connectivity.
- UART communication is handled for receiving external data.

## Functions
- **setup()**: Initializes necessary components and configurations.
- **loop()**: Continuously listens for incoming messages and performs necessary actions.
- Various helper functions for message handling, network operations, and UART communication.

## Notes
- This code is intended for educational and demonstrative purposes.
- Customize and extend the code as per your project requirements.
- Ensure compatibility with your hardware setup and LoRa module specifications.
